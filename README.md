A quickstart project setup for development on Angular and Spring-boot build on maven, you can run this on a single(embeded) tomcat server.

To create angular project, go to app-ui and run ng new [project-name].
Then from the directory of pom.xml, in command prompt, hit mvn clean install.
This will the front-end-client build executions and will install node modules and build the angular code.
